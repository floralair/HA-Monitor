This project monitors the health of Hadoop processes and reports it state.

# It generates a JAR artifact and shell scripts to invoke it -these scripts can run on Linux or OSX
# It generates RPM files that contain the scripts and artifacts, and which install alongside
a pre-existing Hadoop installation -from which this tool picks up the Hadoop artifacts.
# it will only completely build and run on 64-bit Linux.


Tools
* JDK 6+
* Ant 1.8.2+
* rpmtools

For native binaries:
* gcc



Building the JAR:

  ant clean package

 -creates the hmonitor JAR under target/

Running the unit tests:

  ant clean test

Building the binaries, copying the artifacts, dependencies and scripts into a tar file for standalone use

  ant clean tar

 -creates the tar file and a .tar.gz version under target/tar


Building the tar file, then untarring it so that its scripts can be executed directly

 ant clean untar
 
 -The artifacts and scripts will now be under target/untar
 
 any of the scripts can be invoked here, e.g
  target/untar/haprobe.sh -fs hdfs://localhost:8020




== Building RPMS ==

 ant rpm
 
To increment the version counter

1. edit src/main/scripts/rpm/rpm.properties
2. increment the number in the property "rpm.release.counter"
3. do a clean build of the RPMs

== Distributing to Dropbox ==

The build file can deliver the files to dropbox

* create a dropbox account
* mount the drive somewhere on the Linux filesystem

in hmonitor/build.properties  (create this if needed), add entries pointing to the locations

dropbox.dist.dir=/Users/stevel/Dropbox/hmonitor


then:

 ant dropbox-rpm    //builds the RPMs and copies them over to ${dropbox.dist.dir}
